# Teachers' point of view

This session supports educators in designing and implementing meaningful Service Learning experiences that are aligned with course objectives, student needs, and institutional resources. It outlines practical strategies and tools to guide teachers through the planning process, ensuring both pedagogical depth and operational feasibility.

Teachers are introduced to three adaptable scenario types—Challenge-Based Simulation, Structured Service Learning, and Immersive Service Learning—each offering distinct advantages depending on context. A comprehensive **Teacher Preparation Sheet** helps map learning outcomes, assess institutional impact, and plan logistics, while an **AI-powered reflective prompt** guides educators through critical decision-making points such as curriculum alignment, assessment strategies, and community partnerships.

The session also includes **sample evaluation rubrics** (for student presentations, peer assessments, and partner feedback), and resources like an **Image Rights Release Form**, offering templates and language to streamline planning and ensure ethical practice. Whether you are new to Service Learning or seeking to refine your approach, this section offers concrete tools and reflective prompts to support impactful, student-centered learning through civic engagement.
