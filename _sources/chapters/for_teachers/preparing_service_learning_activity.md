# For teachers: Preparing a Service Learning Activity

> üß≠ **Getting Started: Planning Your Service Learning Activity**  
> Designing a Service Learning experience that is both pedagogically meaningful and logistically feasible requires thoughtful planning. Below, we present three possible approaches‚Äîor scenario types‚Äîthat teachers can adopt depending on their course goals, student profile, and level of institutional support. Each model offers distinct advantages and challenges. To support your planning, we also provide a Teacher Preparation Sheet and a reflective AI-powered prompt to help you define learning outcomes, align the activity with your curriculum, anticipate administrative needs, and evaluate the expected impact on the partner institution and the students. Choose the model that best fits your teaching style, and use the tools provided to craft a purposeful, sustainable, and impactful Service Learning activity.

### üìã Reflective Prompt (Copy and Paste)



Here‚Äôs a prompt you can use to help you reflect and complete each section of the Preparation Sheet.

```
I'm designing a service learning project for my course and I‚Äôd like your help crafting a comprehensive and impactful plan. Please walk me through a reflective process to complete a Teacher Preparation Sheet, focusing on both pedagogical and practical aspects. I want to ensure that the activity:
Aligns with my course‚Äôs learning outcomes and curricular goals
Challenges students to apply disciplinary knowledge in a real-world context
Benefits the social institution in a meaningful, sustainable way
Is feasible given my students‚Äô profile and institutional resources
Help me define and refine the following:
Clear, measurable learning outcomes linked to specific competencies (cognitive, social, civic)
How the activity maps onto my course or program goals (integration with curriculum)
The kind of impact the institution might expect‚Äîand how to ethically manage expectations
The most appropriate service learning scenario type (simulation, teacher-led, student-led) based on my teaching style and class profile
A timeline and calendar that accounts for both classroom and field work
Logistical requirements (authorizations, forms, permissions, risk management)
Possible assessment strategies (rubrics, reflections, peer feedback, presentations)
Reflection activities that encourage metacognition and social awareness
Appropriate tools/platforms to support student planning and communication
A realistic list of potential social partners and how to approach them
Here is a short summary of my course, students, and any initial ideas I have:
[Insert context here]
Please prompt me with questions or suggestions for each section. I'd like to generate a polished preparation document from this.
