### Task 4.1
Now, focus on brainstorming potential solutions. Use the prompt provided to guide your brainstorming process.

**Prompt:**  
```
Considering our academic background in [insert your course/subject here], please guide us in using the SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to generate 8–10 innovative ideas.

After generating these SCAMPER-based ideas, help us formulate a set of 'How might we…' questions that challenge assumptions about the problem and spark disruptive thinking. These questions should open new perspectives, uncover hidden needs, or invite bold, creative shifts.  
Importantly, please ensure that all suggested ideas are:  
- Feasible for us to help implement or prototype as university students  
- Relevant to our subject matter and competencies  
- Adaptable to the resources, time, and institutional context we are working within
