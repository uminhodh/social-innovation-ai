# Guideline for Students

This session supports students in engaging meaningfully with social challenges through **Service Learning** combined with **Artificial Intelligence**. It provides a clear, step-by-step guide to help students collaborate effectively with social institutions, develop AI-informed solutions, and build skills in teamwork, innovation, and civic engagement.

Students are introduced to a structured process that includes researching social partners, identifying key challenges, brainstorming and selecting solutions, and presenting their proposals through compelling pitches or podcasts. Practical prompts and **AI-assisted tools** are provided throughout to encourage critical thinking, communication, and reflection.

The session also includes templates and resources such as interview scripts, brainstorming frameworks (e.g., SCAMPER), solution planning guides, and pitch preparation aids. These materials support students at every stage—from initial research to final presentation—helping ensure their projects are feasible, impactful, and aligned with real community needs. Whether new to Service Learning or experienced changemakers, students will gain hands-on experience making a positive social impact through collaborative innovation.
