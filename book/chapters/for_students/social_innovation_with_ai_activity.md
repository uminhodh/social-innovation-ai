# Step 4: Brainstorming for a solution

**Task 4.1: Now, focus on brainstorming potential solutions. Use the prompt provided to guide your brainstorming process.**

```
Considering our academic background in [insert your course/subject here], please guide us in using the SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to generate 8â€“10 innovative ideas. These should be adaptations or creative combinations of existing social programs, methods, or tools that are relevant to both the problem and our field of study.
After generating these SCAMPER-based ideas, help us formulate a set of 'How might weâ€¦' questions that challenge assumptions about the problem and spark disruptive thinking. These questions should open new perspectives, uncover hidden needs, or invite bold, creative shifts.
Importantly, please ensure that all suggested ideas are:
Feasible for us to help implement or prototype as university students
Relevant to our subject matter and competencies
Adaptable to the resources, time, and institutional context we are working within
Context:
[Insert brief description of the social institutionâ€™s challenge here]
```


**Task 4.2: Narrow down the solutions, using the following prompt.**
```
Perform a detailed SWOT analysis for each proposed solution, focusing on long-term sustainability and possible unintended consequences. Then, create a multi-criteria decision matrix to rank the solutions based on feasibility, impact, cost, and ethical considerations. Use this to select the most balanced and practical options.
Context:
[Insert the 3 solutions you have selected]


```


# Step 5: Developing a plan

Task 5.1: Let's create a detailed plan for the solution you've selected, guided by the following prompt.

Objectives & Outcomes â€“ What are our main goals, and how can we define clear, measurable outcomes for our solution?
Tasks & Timeline â€“ What steps should we follow to implement the solution? Who is responsible for what? Can you help us design a timeline that fits a university project schedule?
Resources Needed â€“ What materials, approvals, tools, or support will we need?
Stakeholders & Communication â€“ Who are the key people involved, and how should we communicate with them effectively?
Risks & Contingencies â€“ What are the possible risks, and how can we prepare backup strategies?
Monitoring & Evaluation â€“ How can we track progress and assess whether our solution is working as intended?
